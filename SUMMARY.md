**Off-Road Terrain for Autonomous Vehicles** is a dataset for a classification task. It is used in the automotive industry. 

The dataset consists of 12730 images with 0 labeled objects belonging to 0 classes. There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Dataset contains the corresponding sensor data from a global positioning system (GPS, inertial measurement units (IMUs), a wheel rotation speed sensor, z-axis acceleration). In general, all sensor and label data recorded in seven CSV files (<i>accelerometer_calibrated_split.csv</i>, <i>gps.csv</i>, <i>gyroscope_calibrated_split.csv</i>, <i>magnetometer_split.csv</i> and <i>record.csv</i> - for Sensor Data, <i>tsm_1_labels.csv</i>, </i>tsm_2_labels.csv</i> - for Image Labels). All data has been carefully transferred to tag format: ***tsm1_original***, ***tsm2_k2*** ... etc. from <i>tsm_1_labels.csv</i> and tsm_2_labels, ***accel_x (counts)***, ***calibrated_accel_x (g)***... etc. from <i>accelerometer_calibrated_split.csv</i> etc. Each column in the source data corresponds to a tag, except utc_s(s) and utc_ms(ms) (this data contains in image name). Please note, that not every image has a tag due to differences in the frequency of data collection.. The dataset was released in 2021 by the Vanderbilt University.
